# VM Pools

*Since 4.0.0*

Not all VMs are replacements for carefully maintained individual PCs.
In many workplaces, a standard configuration can be used where 
user-specific data is kept in each user's home directory on a shared
file system. In such cases, an alternative to providing individual
PCs is to offer a pool of VMs and allocate them from the pool to users
as needed.

## Pool definitions

The VM-operator supports this use case with a CRD for pools.

```yaml
apiVersion: "vmoperator.jdrupes.org/v1"
kind: VmPool
metadata:
  namespace: vmop-dev
  name: test-vms
spec:
  retention: "PT4h"
  loginOnAssignment: true
  permissions:
  - user: admin
    may:
    - accessConsole
    - start
  - role: user
    may:
    - accessConsole
    - start
```

The `retention` specifies how long the assignment of a VM from the pool to
a user is retained after the user closes the console. This allows a user
to interrupt his work for this period of time without risking that
another user takes over the VM. The time is specified as
[ISO 8601 duration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations).

Setting `loginOnAssignment` to `true` triggers automatic login of the
user (as described in [section auto login](auto-login.html)) when
the VM is assigned. The `permissions` property defines what a user can
do with a VM assigned to him.

VMs become members of one (or more) pools by adding the pool name to
property `spec.pools` (an array of strings), e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: "vmoperator.jdrupes.org/v1"
kind: VirtualMachine

spec:
  pools:
    - test-vms
```

## Accessing a VM from the pool

Users can access a VM from a pool using the widget described in
[user view](user-gui.html). The widget must be configured to
provide access to a pool instead of to a specific VM.

Assignment happens when the "start" icon is pushed. If the assigned VM
is not running, it will also be started. The assigned VM's name is
shown in the widget above the action icons.

Apart from showing the assigned VM, the widget behaves in the same way
as it does when configured to access a specific VM.

## Requirements on the guest

Some provisions must be made on the guest to ensure that VMs from
pools work as expected.

### Shared file system

Mount a shared file system as home file system on all VMs in the pool.
When using the
[sample agent](https://github.com/mnlipp/VM-Operator/tree/main/dev-example/vmop-agent),
the filesystem must support POSIX file access control lists (ACLs).

### User management

All VMs in the pool must map a given user name to the same user
id. This is typically accomplished by using a central user management,
such as LDAP. The drawback of such a solution is that it is rather
complicated to configure.

As an alternative, the sample auto login agent provides a very simple
approach that uses the shared home directory for managing the user ids.
Simplified, the script searches for a home directory with the given user
name and derives the user id from it. It then checks if the user id is
known by the guest operating system. If not, the user is added.

Details can be found in the comments of the sample script.
